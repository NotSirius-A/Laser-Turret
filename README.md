# Laser-Turret

## Description
It is basically a joystick controlled laser pointer with some basic features. On one of the walls there is an LCD screen that's displaying laser's current position in degrees and diode temperature. Laser is rotated through two connected servos, moving in either X or Y axis. Temperature is measured with a thermistor. Also, on the side, there is a potentiometer, which is used to control movement speed. Everything is managed by an Arduino Nano microcontroller.
